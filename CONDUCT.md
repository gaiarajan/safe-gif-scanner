Welcome to the SafeGIF repository! Because this project has substantial stakes and ethics considerations, I find it important to define some broad standards for a more inclusive repository.

## 1. Be kind. 
In a [2017 survey by GitHub](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/), 50% of 5,500 respondents answered that they had witnessed toxic interactions while working on open-source projects. Almost half had encountered rudeness, and 11% had encountered stereotyping of marginalized groups. This toxicity actively threatens inclusion and promotes a cis-straight-white hegemony within tech. Discriminatory or rude comments will not be tolerated: we should all be working to make the tech space more inclusive, welcoming, and kind. 
## 2. Consider bad actors. 
The code we collaborate on, while created with good intentions, could be used to compound the problem of malicious GIF targeting against individuals with photosensitive epilepsy. For this reason, I'm [not releasing the corruption testing algorithm](https://github.com/grajan22/safe-gif-scanner#note-on-testing), and I will only publicly publish code that I've determined doesn't have obvious nefarious applications. 
## 3. Cite. 

Most of my knowledge about photosensitive epilepsy comes from neurology researchers, not computer scientists. Since this repository relies on research, I affirm the importance of citations in creating a dynamic, equitable community. All new algorithm contributions require either a citation or brief explanation of origin.
